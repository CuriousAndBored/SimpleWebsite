                        In 2017… we started out by experimenting with plant - based ice cream recipes in a no-frill family home kitchen. Our goal was to develop a nice cream that was better-for-you (and the planet!) than the conventional options available… and to prove that the plant based label or a healthier option does not mean you have to compromise on taste.

                        We strive to create the kind of company that’s feel good and fun to support, work for, and partner with. We believe in building a more conscious community through our ice cream. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!
